### The Terminal: Old School Computing
Before your computer had a desktop with menus, icons, and folders, there was just the `terminal`. In the early days of computing, your computer might have looked something like this:

### The Terminal (That You Won't Find at the Airport)
Until the mid-1980s, the main way people interacted with their computer was through the terminal. It's a type of `command line interface`. To create folders or move files around, the **user has to type a text command into this intimidating black box, press enter, and the computer runs that command**.

### Can You Say Gooey?
But then the `graphical user interface` (GUI, pronounced GOO-ey) exploded on the scene and changed everything. The GUI is the **interface that allows you to interact with your computer through visual elements like windows, menus, icons, and pointers**. It's the desktop we've come to know and love.

### Terminal is Still King
Still, the terminal hasn't gone away. In fact, as a developer, the terminal will become your primary mode of communicating with your computer. It allows you to navigate more quickly and efficiently and provides a direct route to the innerworkings of your computer.
