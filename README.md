## Welcome to The Terminal.

In this lesson you're going to learn the fundamental tool for computer programming, your terminal. In the days of yore, the terminal was the only way you could interact with a computer. You had to actually type commands to create files and move around the different folders in your computer. 

In this lesson, you're going to learn all the tricks that developers use every day to maximize their time, with command line. By the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

1 Understand and explain what terminal is and why we use it.

2 Navigate through directories using relative and absolute paths

3 use the cd command to move up and down directories

4 Use the ‘ls’ keyword to list items in a directory

5 Remove a file and a directory by using ‘rm’ and ‘rm -rf’ keywords

6 move files and directories using the mv command
