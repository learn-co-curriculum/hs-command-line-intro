## Welcome to the Terminal

#### Old School Computing
Before your computer had a desktop with menus, icons, and folders, there was just the `terminal`. In the early days of computing, your computer might have looked something like this:

#### The Terminal (That You Won't Find at the Airport)
Until the mid-1980s, the main way people interacted with their computer was through the terminal. It's a type of `command line interface`. To create folders or move files around, the **user has to type a text command into this intimidating black box, press enter, and the computer runs that command**.

#### Can You Say Gooey?
But then the `graphical user interface` (GUI, pronounced GOO-ey) exploded on the scene and changed everything. The GUI is the **interface that allows you to interact with your computer through visual elements like windows, menus, icons, and pointers**. It's the desktop we've come to know and love.

#### Terminal is Still King
Still, the terminal hasn't gone away. In fact, as a developer, the terminal will become your primary mode of communicating with your computer. It allows you to navigate more quickly and efficiently and provides a direct route to the innerworkings of your computer.

#### Stay Tuned
In this lesson, you're going to learn all the tricks that developers use every day to maximize their productivity, with the command line. By the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

1. Understand and explain what the terminal is and why we use it
2. Navigate through directories using relative and absolute paths
3. Use the `cd` command to move up and down directories
4. Use the `ls` keyword to list items in a directory
5. Remove a file and a directory by using `rm` and `rm -rf` keywords
6. move files and directories using the `mv` command

#### Key Terms
* `Terminal` : A text-based tool that allows you to communicate with your computer. The user types a line of text into a simple prompt, and the computer runs that command. On OS X your terminal is an application appropriately called Terminal. <br>
* `Graphical User Interface` : A graphical display that allows you to communicate with your computer through icons and other visual elements like pointers, folders, and menus. Think Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X.
